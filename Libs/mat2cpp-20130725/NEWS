$head 2013-07-25$$
Use 3 standard deviations, instead of two, when checking results
in $cref/randn C++ example/randn/C++/Example/$$ 
(because two standard deviations was failing to often).

$head 2013-07-20$$
Added the $cref mztuni$$ function so that random number generation
was repeatable on different machines.
In addition, seeded the random numbers off the clock
so that a different test is run each time (but can be reproduced
in the case of an error).

$head 06-05-15$$
Added $xref/randn/$$ library routine.
Also added the section $tref library$$ to the documentation.

$head 06-05-05$$
Added the $xref/cholesky/$$ library routine.

$head 06-04-18$$
Release of first version.
